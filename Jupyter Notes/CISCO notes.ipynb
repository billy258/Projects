    "- Octals can be made from binary numericals by grouping consecutive binary digits into groups of three (starting from the right).\n",

    "eg. the binary representation for decimal 74 is 1001010. Two zeros can be added at the left: (00)1 001 010, corresponding the octal digits 112 yielding the octal representation 112.\n",

    "If an integar number is preceded by an `0o` or `0O` prefix (zero-o), it will be treated as an octal value. This means that the number must contain digits taken from the 0-7 range only. EG, `0o123` is an octal number with a (decimal) value equal to `83`\n",

Each hexadecimal digit represents four binary digits (also known as a **nibble**) which is half a byte. for example, a single byte can have the binary digits ranging from 00000000 to 11111111, which can be conviently represented as 00 to FF in hexadecimal.\n",
    "- Hex is used in **plaintext transfer encoding**, where each byte of the plaintext is broken into two 4-bit values and represented by two hex digits.\n",

    "### Creating Modules \n",
    "\n",
    "> A __module__ is a kind of container filled with functions (as many functions as you need).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Grouping the modules creates a __package__.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When you import another python module (/file) fro mthe same folder, python will make another folder called **__pycache__**.\n",
    "  - The file name inside the file will mostly be \"module.cpython-xy.pyc\" where x and y are the difits derived from your version of python.\n",
    "  - the `.pyc` means python and complied.\n",
    "  - This means python semi-compiles the file (not into machine code) making it run faster.\n",
    "  - Python is able to detect if there are any changes made to the module and will only rebuild the `.pyc` file if there are any changes made to the module. \n",
    "\n",
    "- When a module is imported, its content is __implicitly executed by python__. It gives the module the chance to initialize some of its internal aspects (eg. it may assign some variables wit huseful values). \n",
    "  - The initialization takes place only once, when the first import occurs, so the assignments done by the module aren't repeated unnecessarily.\n",
    "  \n",
    "EG. \n",
    "  - There is a module named `mod1`\n",
    "  - There is a module named `mod2` which contains the `import mod1` and `import mod2` instructions. \n",
    "    - `mod1` isn't imported twice since python can silently omit all subsquent imports. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Python also creates a variable called `__name__`.\n",
    "  - When you run a file directly, its `__name__` variable is set to `__main__`.\n",
    "  - When a file is imported as a module, its `__name__` variable is set to the file's name (excluding the `.py`)\n",
    "  - This can be usful when checking the functions in the module are working as intended. (ie, print statements when you run the module as a file).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- If you want the module user to not change a variable the variable name (by convention) will have a `_` or `__` in front of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A line starting with `#!` (called a 'shebang' etc...) is just a comment to python however to a unix or unix-like operating system, such a line instructs the OS how to execute the contents of the file (ie what program needs to be launched to interpret the text).\n",
    "\n",
    "> A __doc-string__ is a string that is placed before any module imstructions (including imports). This should breifly explain the purpose and contents of the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using the `__name__` variable can tell you whether the module is being excuted as a file or as a module....\n"
